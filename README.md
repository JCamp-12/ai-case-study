## Overview and Origin

* **Cognition Labs / Devin AI**

* Scott Wu founded Cognition Labs in November 2023

* Scott Wu (CEO), Steven Hao (CTO), and Walden Yang (Chief Product Officer)

* With Devin, the goal and aim is to have an AI "buddy" that can team up with real engineers. Devin can handle the day-to-day stuff, which lets engineers solve bigger, tougher problems.  It is labeled as AI as a software engineer.

* Most recently, Cognition has received a $21 million investment from Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm Founders Fund. Peter Thiel was the former CEO of PayPal and is the co-founder of Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm that invests in companies building revolutionary technologies. It has also received major support from other big names such as Patrick and John Collison, Elad Gil, Sarah Guo, Chris Re, Eric Glyman, and many more.

## Business Activities

* As a groundbreaking AI software engineer, Devin, is designed to revolutionize software development through collaboration with humans.  It is designed to enhance productivity rather than replace.  Software and tech is quickly becoming part of every business and any company that is not is likely to be disrupted by ones that are.

* While there is no specific information that I could find about the total addressable market specifically for Devin AI... The global software market size was valued at USD 583.47 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2023 to 2030.  This to me feels low but I aw this quoted multiple places.  The market cap of Apple alone is $3 trillion dollars and there are 5 current trillion dollar companies all in tech.

* There is likely to be a fierce competition to be part of the tooling of every software engineer at every company and get the per employee license cost there will be competiion from the likes of Microsoft/Github Co-Pilot or Open AI Chat GPT.  What makes Devin interesting is the skill level and size of the team.  AI is starting to allow smaller, highly skilled startups take on larger established players in tech like Google search to begin seeing increased competition and increasingly likely their own disruption.

* Finding the exact tooling Devin AI is built on is likely proprietary at this point and closely guarded.  It is likely fine tuned and RAG architecture along with way to reinforce learning.  From the Cognition Labs blog: We are an applied AI lab focused on reasoning.
‍
We’re building AI teammates with capabilities far beyond today’s existing AI tools. By solving reasoning, we can unlock new possibilities in a wide range of disciplines—code is just the beginning. We want to help people around the world turn their ideas into reality.

## Landscape

* Business / Software

* The major recent trends in Business software the last 5 -10 years is Cloud Computing, AI/ML, Mobile Development, and blockchain.

* The main competitor is likely the Open AI / Microsoft partnership along with Google and Facebook.

## Results

* It is hard to quantify results at this point, there are impressive benchmarks that Devin is meeting: Devin was evaluated on SWE-bench, a challenging benchmark that asks agents to resolve real-world GitHub issues found in open source projects like Django and scikit-learn.

  * > Devin correctly resolves 13.86%* of the issues end-to-end, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art of 1.96%. Even when given the exact files to edit, the best previous models can only resolve 4.80% of issues.

* Currently Devin is garnering a lot of attention, in a similar way that Chap GPT did upon release.

* While Devin is currently only in early access and therefore hard to test it is garnering a significant amount of attention (I would describe it as positive and generating some fear it could become go beyond its promise to be a productivity enhancement and be a replacement for software engineers) due to its promise and the considerable talent behind the product.

## Recommendations

* Based on the ability of the product to reason my recommendation would be to introduce consulting as a service, software engineering as a service, and looking to get into cyber security.

* These are services that every company needs and currently is heavily investing in.  The goal would be to continue to enhance productivity and to increase the effectiveness of consulting services and security in addition to software engineering ai.  Accenture has a market cap of $230 Billion, it is a small leap from reasoning in software to information technology and consulting.  The ability of AI to understand domain specific information technology seems likely, and pairs wells in addition to software development.
